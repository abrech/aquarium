- scale fish speed when eating relative to difference between last distances -> increase speed, when food is faster
- sync speed and angle: angles from 91 - 270 left, rest right


## genetics
- correlation food/fish size -> only some fish can succesfully chase food
- ?less reward when food on ground



turn fish around when foood detected based on direction
